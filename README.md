<h1>portfolio-2023</h1>
My first portfolio site, where I showcase my projects.

<h2>What was my motivation?</h2>
My motivation behind this project was to showcase all the skills I have learned over the past 4 months and in the best case increase my chances of getting hired as a junior web developer.
Besides that, I also wanted to prove to myself that I am now capable of developing a professional website from the ground off, which means the concept, the design, and the development of the site.

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to work with react scroll and react spring.</li>
  <li>How to work properly with CSS animations, transitions, media queries, advanced selectors, SVG animations, Webkits, browser compatibility, and all that together in a responsive design.</li>
  <li>Setting up large media for Netlify and GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What would I do better next time?</h2>
DonÂ´t just start coding without a clear concept. Maybe create the website in Figma or InDesign first and then start with the development,
because I lost a lot of time switching around my ideas for example the navbar I reworked 4 times. The About section 3 times, and the Projects section also 3 times, and when this 
is of course good for learning CSS it gets annoying reworking a section again and again. But I wanted to have everything perfect, at least for me, so I had to rework everything until I was happy.
But for the next project, I will definitely do the design work in a design program and not in CSS until I am 100% happy with the design.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall I am very happy with the final result. I put a lot of effort into the project and it paid off.
